## PART 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & VISION

### 1.1 The ATHENA Mission

ATHENA is a **comprehensive Life Operating System for Women** that orchestrates every stage of a woman's economic journey—from education and career, through entrepreneurship and wealth-building, to community leadership and generational wealth creation.

**Core Promise:** Empower 500 million women globally to achieve financial independence, build enterprises, and create generational wealth through a single integrated platform.

**Why ATHENA Exists:**
- Women earn on average 20-30% less than men globally
- Only 2-3% of VC funding goes to women founders
- 70% of women report barriers to financial planning and wealth building
- 1.1 billion women in workforce lack integrated economic support systems
- Existing platforms are transactional, not transformational

**What ATHENA Solves:**
1. **Fragmentation:** Women use 7-10 separate apps for career, finance, education, and community
2. **Safety:** Generic platforms lack women-specific safety features and trust mechanisms
3. **Discovery:** No intelligent matching between women's aspirations and opportunities
4. **Mentorship:** Limited access to peer support and reverse mentorship
5. **Capital Access:** Entrepreneurs face systemic barriers to funding and resources
6. **Data Blindness:** No longitudinal tracking of women's economic journeys

### 6.5 Video Feed Algorithm (OpportunityVerse)

**Purpose:** Surface the most relevant career-focused video content while driving economic outcomes

#### Three-Stage Pipeline

**Stage 1: Candidate Sourcing**
```
Video Pool → 10 Million daily videos
            ↓
Filter 1: In-Network (content from followed creators)
          [30% of final feed]
          
Filter 2: Out-of-Network (recommended based on interests)
          - SimClusters: Community detection
          - Embedding spaces: Content similarity
          - Social graph: Users with similar interests
          [50% of final feed]
          
Filter 3: Trending (viral/breakout content)
          [20% of final feed]
          
RESULT: 1,500 candidate videos (from 10M pool)
```

**Stage 2: Ranking (Custom Scoring Model)**

ATHENA's proprietary ranking considers **21 factors** organized in 4 categories:

| Category | Weight | Key Factors |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **A. Engagement Signals** | 40% | Watch time, completion rate, likes/views, comments/views, shares/views, time to interact |
| **B. Relevance Signals** | 30% | User's career stage, skills demonstrated, industry alignment, language, audio/caption quality |
| **C. Opportunity Signals** | 20% | Mentorship opportunities, job openings, funding/capital access, skills marketplace, community matching |
| **D. Safety Signals** | 10% | Harassment detection, misinformation score, safety certifications, community feedback |

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Score = (40% × Engagement) + (30% × Relevance) + (20% × Opportunity) + (10% × Safety)

Example:
Video A: Career returner shares first week at new job
- Engagement: 8/10 (68% completion, good comment ratio)
- Relevance: 9/10 (returner watching returner content)
- Opportunity: 8/10 (mentions mentor who helped her)
- Safety: 10/10 (verified, no flags)
- **Final Score: 8.3/10**

Video B: Luxury lifestyle video (not career-related)
- Engagement: 9/10 (95% completion, viral shares)
- Relevance: 2/10 (not career/skill related)
- Opportunity: 1/10 (no economic value)
- Safety: 8/10 (some complaints)
- **Final Score: 4.5/10**

Result: Video A ranked higher despite lower raw engagement
```

**Stage 3: Filtering & Diversity Enforcement**

**Hard Filters (Remove entirely):**

- Copyright violations
- Spam/scam content

## PART 15: RISK MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION

### 15.1 Comprehensive Risk Register

#### Market & Competitive Risks

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Competition from LinkedIn** | Critical | 60% | Lose user base, slow growth | Differentiate on women-first, creator economy, mentorship depth. Vertical focus. |
| **Tech Platforms (TikTok) enter HR** | High | 40% | Cannibalization of creator base | Diversify revenue (subscriptions, B2B), integrate existing platforms (don't compete). |
| **Economic recession** | High | 50% | Reduced premium subscriptions, lower hiring | Build resilience features (free tier expansion), diversify revenue (education, financial). |
| **Failure to achieve product-market fit** | Critical | 20% | Slow user growth, fundraising difficulty | Rigorous user testing, pivot options documented, founder experience. |

---

#### Operational Risks

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Key person dependency** | High | 70% | Founder exit, knowledge loss | Cross-training, documentation, hire COO by Month 6. |
| **Data breach/security incident** | Critical | 20% | Regulatory fines, trust loss, reputational damage | SOC 2 Type II, penetration testing, insurance, incident response plan. |
| **Scaling infrastructure fails** | High | 30% | Downtime, poor user experience | Load testing, multi-region failover, DPO <15min. |
| **Payment processor issue** | High | 15% | Revenue disruption | Multiple processors (Stripe + Adyen), fallback payment method. |

---

#### Regulatory & Compliance Risks

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|

| **Misclassification of creators as employees** | High | 25% | Tax liability, IR classification risk | Legal review, contractor agreement clarity, withholding compliance. |
| **Workplace harassment claims** | Medium | 30% | Legal costs, reputation, moderation burden | Community guidelines, moderation SLA, transparency reports, insurance. |

---

### 15.2 Regulatory & Compliance Risks

#### Employment Law Compliance

**Australia:**
- Equal Opportunity Act compliance (no discrimination)
- Minimum wage (ensure recommended jobs meet minimum wage)
- Leave entitlements (provide transparency on leave policies)

**Mitigation:** Legal review, partnership with HR law firm, employer verification process

---

#### Privacy & Data Protection

**Australia - Privacy Act:**
- Collection: Only collect necessary data (purpose limitation)
