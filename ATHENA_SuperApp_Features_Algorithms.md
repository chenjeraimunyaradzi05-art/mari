### 2.2 Short-Form Video Algorithm (TikTok + X-Inspired + Proprietary)

#### **TikTok's Proven Algorithm Framework**
TikTok's algorithm uses 9 core ranking factors:
1. **Likes** (strength of positive engagement)
2. **Comments** (deeper engagement signals)
3. **Shares** (content worth spreading)
4. **Watch time** (how long users watch)
5. **Profile visits** (interest in creator)
6. **Subscriptions** (follow after watching)
7. **Sounds** (trending audio drives reach)
8. **Hashtags** (topic discovery)
9. **Description** (relevance keywords)

**TikTok weights these by:**
- Neural networks analyzing patterns
- Real-time data processing
- Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequence prediction
- Video completion rate (most important)
- First 3 seconds engagement (critical)

#### **ATHENA's Enhanced Algorithm: "OpportunityVerse"**

**Three-Stage Pipeline:**

**Stage 1: Candidate Sourcing**
```
Video Pool → 10 Million daily videos
            ↓
Filter 1: In-Network (content from followed creators)
          [30% of final feed]
          
Filter 2: Out-of-Network (recommended based on interests)
          - SimClusters: Community detection
          - Embedding spaces: Content similarity
          - Social graph: Users with similar interests
          [50% of final feed]
          
Filter 3: Trending (viral/breakout content)
          [20% of final feed]
          
RESULT: 1,500 candidate videos (from 10M pool)
```

**Stage 2: Ranking (Custom Scoring Model)**

ATHENA's proprietary ranking considers **21 factors** organized in 4 categories:

**A. Engagement Signals (40% weight)**
- Watch time (most important)
- Completion rate (% video watched)
- Likes per view ratio
- Comments per view ratio
- Shares per view ratio
- Time to interact (how quickly user engages)

**B. Relevance Signals (30% weight)**
- User's career stage (aligned recommendations)
- Skills being demonstrated (matches user's learning goals)
- Industry alignment (videos in user's industry)
- Language + location (cultural relevance)
- Audio/music quality (production value)
- Caption quality (helpful, not clickbait)

**C. Opportunity Signals (20% weight) - ATHENA UNIQUE**
- Mentorship opportunities (video features mentor)
- Job openings (recruiter/employer content)
- Fundraising/capital access (founder networking)
- Skills marketplace (freelance/contract work)
- Community matching (group relevance)
- Event invitations (conferences, workshops)

**D. Safety Signals (10% weight)**
- Harassment detection (content flags)
- Misinformation scoring (fact-check integration)
- Safety certifications (verified accounts)
- Community feedback (user reports)

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Score = (40% × Engagement) + (30% × Relevance) + (20% × Opportunity) + (10% × Safety)

Example video ranking:
Video A: Career returner shares first week at new job
- Engagement: 8/10 (68% completion, good comment ratio)
- Relevance: 9/10 (returner watching returner content)
- Opportunity: 8/10 (mentions mentor who helped her)
- Safety: 10/10 (verified, no flags)
- **Final Score: 8.3/10**

Video B: Luxury lifestyle video (not career-related)
- Engagement: 9/10 (95% completion, viral shares)
- Relevance: 2/10 (not career/skill related)
- Opportunity: 1/10 (no economic value)
- Safety: 8/10 (some complaints)
- **Final Score: 4.5/10**

Result: Video A ranked higher despite lower raw engagement
```

**Stage 3: Filtering & Ranking**

**Hard Filters (Remove entirely):**
- Hate speech, harassment, misinformation
- Sexual/explicit content
- Dangerous activities (no how-to crime, self-harm)
- Copyright violations (unlicensed music, footage)
- Spam/scam content

**Soft Filters (Downrank but don't remove):**

- From accounts with low trust score
- Quality issues (blurry, audio problems)
- Extreme viewpoints (not removed, but downranked)

**Diversity Enforcement:**
- Don't show same creator >3x per session

  * "Industry average for your experience: AU$128k"
  * "Negotiation script: 'I researched this role and...'
  * "Likely counter-offer: AU$115k (plan for this)"
  
Stage 4: Outcome Tracking

## PART 4: X/TWITTER OPEN-SOURCE LEARNINGS

### 4.1 X's Public Algorithm Architecture (Open-Sourced 2023-2026)

X released its recommendation algorithm publicly with these components:

**Four-Stage Pipeline:**

```
Stage 1: Candidate Sourcing (Pull from 500M+ tweets/day)
├── In-Network (your follows)
│   └── Search Index (50% of candidates)
├── Out-of-Network (relevant beyond your network)
│   ├── Social Graph (engagements of people you follow)
│   ├── Embedding Spaces (content similarity)
│   ├── User-Tweet Entity Graph (interaction patterns)
│   └── Follow Recommendation Service (discover new accounts)
└── Result: 1,500 candidate tweets (from 500M+ pool)

Stage 2: Ranking (ML neural network, 48M parameters)
├── Light Ranker (quick first-pass scoring)
├── Heavy Ranker (deep neural net for final scores)
├── Features: 1,000s of signals (engagement, recency, quality)
└── Output: 10 labels per tweet (probability of each engagement type)

Stage 3: Filtering & Heuristics
├── Hard filters (remove: hate speech, NSFW, spam)
├── Soft filters (downrank: controversial, low quality)
├── Visibility filters (legal compliance, policy enforcement)
└── Home mixer (construct final timeline)

Stage 4: Feed Construction & Serving
├── Build personalized timeline for user
├── Serve in <1.5 seconds (SLA: 99.9% uptime)
└── 5 billion executions per day
```

**Key Learnings for ATHENA:**

| X's Approach | ATHENA Adaptation |
|---|---|
| **Candidate sourcing from multiple sources** | Do same: jobs from 10+ sources, mentor network, opportunities |
| **Light + Heavy ranker (fast + accurate)** | 2-tier ranking: fast for FYP, deep for opportunity matches |
| **Neural networks with 1000s of features** | Build ML models with career-specific features (salary, growth) |
| **Real-time processing (5B/day)** | ATHENA processes 100M+ items daily initially, scale to billions |
| **Filtering for safety & compliance** | Build women-first safety filters (no harassment, misinformation) |
| **Transparency: Open source code** | ATHENA to open-source safety algorithms (build trust) |
